                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>Hello there! My name is Gani and I welcome you guys to my ePortfolio. After I have finished the compulsory school, I began an apprenticeship in informatics. Now I am in my first year of my apprenticeship. I live in Lenzburg, city in canton of Aargau, with my parents. I was born in switzerland, my parents came originally from macedonia. So german is besides macedonian my first language. I can also speak english and french. My two sisters are married, and moved out. In my leisure time I love to do something with my family or my friends, like a trip or go to the cinema. Otherwise I like to do sports, most of all team sports, and play video games. I am able to work in a team and I am open for new things. My relatives and friends says that I can listen well and I am responsible. With this portfolio I followed my interest in webdesign. After my apprenticeship, after my military service, I want to study informatics and after that I want to work as a game developer. Thats the reason, why I am doing  my professional baccalaureate, besides my apprenticeship. These thaughts are only valid at the moment, like I said before, I am open to new ideas. I hope, that I was able to introduce myself and now enjoy my portfolio.</p>

                        For my 2nd project I work in a shop. Now the question is, what is a computer scientist doing in a shop? Well, not much to do with computer science. But I wanted to gather experiences in a shop. But why? I am interested in Swisscom's customers and products and a shop represents Swisscom to the outside world, which is why I want to get to know the "front line" and the customer. I can also improve my communication and prove my ability to work under pressure.</p>

                        Maintaining the MacBook-pool was one of my most important tasks. In addition to this task, I created courses in various topics on ADP, an learning tool developed by other apprentices. In addition together with other apprentices cleaning their NAS drive was also one of my tasks.</p>

                        I started my apprenticeship, like all other apprentices, in the first steps. There I got to know my training company better and its training concept. I like it! Besides that I met my coach and my team, and I set up my devices and workplace.</p>
